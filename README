To keep the rc.lua configuration file clean the WINE menu can be placed in
another lua file and imported with the 'require' command, and added to the
default menu as follows

mymainmenu = awful.menu({ items = { { "awesome", myawesomemenu, beautiful.awesome_icon },
                                    { "open terminal", terminal },
                                    { "wine", menu_b9eadba3c35f7f89e93c92eb2c8d39b0 }
                                  }
                        })
