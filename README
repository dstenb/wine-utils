FORMATS

* awesome - Awesome Window Manager
To keep the rc.lua configuration file clean the WINE menu can be placed in
another lua file and imported with the 'require' command, and added to the
default menu as follows

mymainmenu = awful.menu({ items = { { "awesome", myawesomemenu, beautiful.awesome_icon },
                                    { "open terminal", terminal },
                                    { "wine", menu_b9eadba3c35f7f89e93c92eb2c8d39b0 }
                                  }
                        })

* pekwm - PekWM Window Manager
Static menu that should be included in ~/.pekwm/menu

* pekwm-dynamic - Dynamic PekWM Window Manager
Dynamic menu that is reloaded every time it's selected.
This is way more flexible than the normal menu.
The dynamic menu can be included in ~/.pekwm/menu as

Submenu = "WINE" {
	Entry { Actions = "Dynamic /home/david/Code/wine-menu-creator/main.py -f pekwm-dynamic" }
}
